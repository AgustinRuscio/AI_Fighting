# Fight Club

Two agents: the leader (identified by a mark on their head) and the boids (the other agents). The leaders move to where you click (Right click for blue, left for red), and the boids use a "leader following" Streeting behavior. If the target (leader or certain point) is not in line of sight, they will use Theta start to find a path to the location and move to it.
In case of seeing an enemy (being in Field of view) they will start fighting. If life is too low, they will try to escape in order to survive.
